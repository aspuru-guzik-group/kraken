Code to compute electronic and steric features to create a database of ligands and their properties.

This workflow is divided into two portions: conf_search_and_xTB and conf_selection_and_DFT. Each portion has a readme with further information.

Code is provided "as-is." Minor edits may be required to tailor scripts for different computational systems.
